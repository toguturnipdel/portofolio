## 🧠 About Me

Togu Novriansyah Turnip received the **B.AS. degree in informatics engineering from the Politeknik Negeri Bandung, Indonesia**, in 2014, and the **M.I.M. degree in Information Management from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan** in 2016. From 2016 to 2023, he was a lecturer in Del Institute of Technology, North Sumatera, Indonesia.

I am currently a PhD researcher at **DTU Department of Engineering Technology and Didactics, Energy Technology and Computer Science**, working under the supervision of **Prof. Birger Andersen** and **Prof. César Vargas-Rosales (Tecnológico de Monterrey)**.  
My work focuses on integrating **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** into network security protocols, such as **TLS, IPsec, SSH, and 6G-AKA**, emphasizing **formal verification, benchmarking, and hybrid key exchange design**.
